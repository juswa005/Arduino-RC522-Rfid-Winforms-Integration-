# Arduino-RC522-Rfid-Winforms-Integration-
This application allows real-time monitoring of RFID tag scans from an Arduino Uno. The Arduino reads RFID tags using an MFRC522 module and sends the tag UID over serial communication. This WinForms app receives the data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The system can be extended to log attendance or trigger custom actions.
